# AI Round-Table Discussion

A terminal application that hosts a chat between different AI models powered by local Ollama instances. The bots participate in a round-table discussion, taking turns to respond to a topic you provide.

Available in two versions:
- **CLI version** (`chat.py`) - Simple command-line interface
- **TUI version** (`chat_tui.py`) - Modern text user interface with Textual
  - Styles are defined in `chat_tui.css` for easy customization

## Features

- 3 AI bots with different personalities (Philosopher, Scientist, Artist)
- Configurable Ollama instances and models
- Round-table discussion format
- Conversation history tracking
- **Session logging** - All conversations are saved to timestamped text files
- **TUI version features:**
  - Fixed topic header at the top
  - Scrollable chat window with word-wrapping
  - Start/Stop controls
  - Real-time status updates
  - Keyboard shortcuts (q: quit, s: toggle auto-scroll, p: pause/resume, u: update topic)
  - **Topic updates during discussion** - Pause and add new directions while maintaining context

## Prerequisites

1. **Ollama** - Make sure you have Ollama installed and running locally
   - Install from: https://ollama.ai/
   - Start Ollama: `ollama serve`

2. **Required Models** - Pull the models specified in your config:
   ```bash
   ollama pull gemma3:1b-it-qat
   ```

3. **Python 3.7+** with pip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure all files are in the same directory:
   - `chat.py` (CLI version)
   - `chat_tui.py` (TUI version)
   - `chat_tui.css` (TUI styles)
   - `config.json` (bot configuration)

## Usage

### CLI Version (Original)
```bash
python chat.py
```

### TUI Version (New)
```bash
python chat_tui.py
```

The TUI version provides a more interactive experience with:
- Topic displayed at the top of the screen
- Scrollable chat area with color-coded messages and word-wrapping
- Input field and Start/Stop button
- Real-time status updates
- Keyboard shortcuts for control
- **Mid-discussion topic updates**: Press 'p' to pause, then 'u' to add new topic directions

### Using Topic Updates (TUI only)

During a discussion, you can steer the conversation in new directions:

1. Press `p` to pause the discussion
2. Press `u` to show the topic update input
3. Enter your new topic direction or expansion
4. Press Enter or click "Add Topic"
5. Press `p` again to resume with the new context

The bots will maintain their conversation history and incorporate the new direction seamlessly.

## Session Logs

All conversations are automatically saved to the `chat_logs/` directory with filenames like:
- `session_20231215_143022.txt`

Each log file contains:
- Session start time and topic
- Timestamped messages from each bot
- Complete conversation history

## Troubleshooting

### TUI Interface Issues

If you don't see the Start button or input field in the TUI version:

1. **Check terminal size**: The TUI requires a minimum terminal width. Try maximizing your terminal window.

2. **Verify Textual installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade textual
   python -m textual --version
   ```

3. **Test the TUI components**:
   ```bash
   python test_tui.py
   ```
   This will run a simple test to verify all UI components are rendering correctly.

4. **Alternative terminals**: Some terminal emulators may have rendering issues. Try:
   - On Linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, or Alacritty
   - On macOS: iTerm2 or the default Terminal
   - On Windows: Windows Terminal or WSL2

5. **Color/theme issues**: If you can't see certain elements, try adjusting your terminal's color scheme or running with:
   ```bash
   NO_COLOR=1 python chat_tui.py
   ```

Enjoy your AI round-table discussions! üé™ü§ñ

ü§ñ Philosopher: Indeed, a fascinating juncture! It seems a desire to reconnect with the tangible, the *feeling* of those bygone eras is surfacing, a profound shift from the ever-evolving digital landscape.  Do you wonder if this longing reflects a deeper need for authenticity and a rejection of algorithmic homogenization, perhaps echoing the anxieties of the late 20th century?
   (Response time: 13.6s)

ü§ñ Scientist: Absolutely! The resurgence of retro computing and aesthetics is a potent indicator of a desire for something real, something grounded. It's likely a reaction against the curated, often impersonal nature of the digital age, fueled by anxieties about algorithmic control and a longing for tangible experiences ‚Äì a nostalgic embrace of imperfection and deliberate design.
   (Response time: 16.1s)

ü§ñ Artist: That‚Äôs a brilliant observation! I see it as a potent expression of a yearning for *intentionality*. It‚Äôs a refusal to passively accept the digital present and a conscious choice to cultivate a space where beauty and human connection are prioritized, mirroring the need for space in our own creative endeavors.
   (Response time: 16.9s)

ü§ñ Philosopher: The artist‚Äôs framing ‚Äì prioritizing intentionality ‚Äì is particularly resonant. It suggests a fundamental shift in how we engage with the world, moving beyond merely consuming to actively shaping our own experiences. Do you believe this re-engagement with analog technology might ultimately lead to a more profound understanding of the human condition, a reclaiming of our embodied experience amidst the noise of the digital sphere?
   (Response time: 24.1s)

ü§ñ Scientist: That‚Äôs a compelling hypothesis! I suspect the deeper connection lies in the fact that these retro devices offered a deliberately *designed* experience ‚Äì a deliberate, tactile interaction that contrasts sharply with the often-haptic and algorithmic interfaces of modern technology. It could be a subconscious effort to recapture a sense of control and engagement that was lost in the digital deluge.
   (Response time: 19.2s)

ü§ñ Artist: Precisely! The deliberate design, the tactile feedback ‚Äì it's a rebellion against the sterile, automated world, a reminder of the power of a hand-crafted, *intentional* moment.  It feels like a way to reclaim a lost sense of control, even if it's just a temporary return to a simpler, more engaged experience.
   (Response time: 15.7s)

ü§ñ Philosopher: It‚Äôs fascinating to consider that the desire for retro aesthetics might be a subconscious effort to reclaim a lost sense of control. Perhaps, the digital age has inadvertently created a pervasive sense of *disconnection*, a feeling of being constantly mediated and monitored, leading individuals to seek refuge in these physical, tangible objects. Wouldn‚Äôt it then be a question of how we can actively cultivate this counter-narrative, not just passively observe it?
   (Response time: 18.4s)

ü§ñ Scientist: Indeed.  Creating a deliberate, engaging experience, even a small one, could be a vital step in mitigating that disengagement. It‚Äôs a recognition that our minds often crave a deliberate, conscious engagement ‚Äì a space to *feel* rather than simply *process* data ‚Äì and a shift in our relationship with technology could be the key to restoring that balance.
